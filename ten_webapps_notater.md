# I built 10 webapps in 10 progarmming languages

## General information
- Serverside frameworks, all use different programming 

---
## What does a framwork do?
- Provides an abstrancion of relational database
- Proide routing 
- Dynamically insert data to you database from html, view

---
## Ruby on Rails
- Ruby installed, 
- Rail can generate

- Setting up a mapping between urls and an anciton
 
### View
- Allows you to render your data dynamically in a html file
- Retrives data from database and allows you to update database

---
## Django
- File structure sinpler than rails, batteries included
- The code is more explicit
- Routes is defined in the urls.py files
- Model is a python class that defines 
- You can register models you have defined

---
## Larno
- Install php and tool called composer
- A lot of batteries included, can be confusing
- App code is already configured
- Views uses blade templates on top of php

---
## Next.js
- Lets you build fullstack with js
- Provides no intergration for database, need something like prisma
- Javascript ecosystem to complicated, thus you dont want database preinstalled
- Routing is handled in the file system, you grap the file path
- You can run serverside in next.js
- Serverside and clientside is claped toghether, seems simple but makes things simpler

---
## Spring
- Generator that lets you choose your framework, seems more robust than dynamic 
- Controller is a class, 
- Databasemodels

- Urls names are inferred from classnames
- Views are written in cs html
- More verbose than other languages, drawback is selling your soul to microsoft

## Phoneix
- Uses elixir, can scaffold entire crud application
- Phoneix has advantage in performance because of elixir

## Gin
- Uses go, minimal http framework, has no ORM
- Dont need to follow expactations, overkill for most application
- Good for smaller applications

---
## Rust
- Difficult to build a application
- A systen language, average developer does not need it
- Yew, component based 

---
## Vapor
- Uses swift which works better on mac
- Classes and decorators to model data
- Code is consise and readable 
- Felt very modern and practical
